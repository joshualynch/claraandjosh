					<img class="img-circle pull-right" alt="Clara and Josh at the Broadway Grill, where they had their first date." src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www.claraandjosh.com/img/clara-josh-broadway-grill.jpg" />
		
					<p class="lead">Clara and Josh were brought together by a psychoactive plant called Salvia.</p> 
					
					<p>The year was 2008, and Josh was a staff writer for the Seattle University Spectator. He pitched a story about the legal hallucinogen, and luckily Clara was the photographer assigned. The writer and photographer duo met for the first time, then spent a sunny January afternoon walking to smoke shops around campus reporting on salvia.</p>
					
					<p>Clara and Josh had an instant connection. But a year later, despite flirting at the Photographic Center Northwest where they both took classes, Josh still hadn't made a move.</p>
					
				</div>
		
				<div class="span6">
		
					<p>So Clara went after her boss (Josh was now editor of The Spectator) by asking him to a party at her apartment, and after talking well into the middle of the night on Katie Farden's mom's blue sectional couch, Josh finally had the courage to ask Clara out. A few days later, Jan. 31 2009, Clara and Josh went on their first date to Broadway Grill where they both had burgers.</p>
					
					<p>It didn't take many dates for the two to fall in love (Clara knew Josh was a keeper when he took her to Vegas senior year), and in June 2010, Clara and Josh graduated from Seattle University and moved in together. They enjoy bicycling, motorcycling, hiking, Kindle reading and vegetarian cooking together. Clara works at the online jewelry retailer <a href="http://www.bluenile.com/">Blue Nile</a> as a photo technician and is also a wedding photographer. Josh is product manager at <a href="http://www.lexblog.com/">LexBlog</a>, where he develops web products and services for law firms and attorneys.</p>

			<div class="row-fluid">
		
				<div class="span6">
				
					<img class="img-circle pull-right" alt="Clara and Josh's view from the Outlook Inn on Orcas Island." src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www.claraandjosh.com/img/clara-josh-view-from-outlook-inn.jpg" />
		
					<p class="lead">It was 6:30 on a Saturday morning as they got in the car with luggage, and Josh still wouldn't tell Clara where they were headed.</p>

					<p>Two weeks before Josh had mysteriously "reserved" the weekend for time together, and the only hint he gave Clara as they headed out the door Dec. 8 was him asking "Can you grab the passports?" (Classic misdirection.)</p>
					
					<p>When they pulled up to the ferry terminal and Josh bought tickets to Orcas Island, Clara figured out they weren't headed to Canada yet again. Instead they enjoyed a sunny ferry ride through the San Juan Islands to Orcas, where Josh insisted on going for a walk in the area around the ferry landing.</p>
					
					<p>At the end of a dock, Josh asked Clara if she wanted to see where they were going and handed her his phone.</p>

				</div>
		
				<div class="span6">
				
					<p>At this point, Clara was skeptical that Josh even had a plan for the weekend but tapped the Maps app so he could show her.</p>
		
					<p>Instead of Google Maps, Clara saw an app Josh had been building for weeks after she went to bed. She flipped through pages of photos and captions of their adventures, inside jokes and life together.</p> 
					
					<p>The last page of Josh's proposal app popped the question "Will you marry me?" as he asked it out loud. Clara looked up to find Josh on one knee with her great grandma Clara Sundmacher's engagement ring, which Clara's parents had graciously offered and delivered to Josh in November. Clara said yes (surprise!), and as they walked off the dock an unexpected audience from a boat that had arrived mid-proposal cheered for them.</p>

					<p>Clara and Josh spent the rest of the day hiking to the observation tower on Mount Constitution, exploring Orcas Island, celebrating at Chimayo's Italian Restaurant and relaxing at <a href="http://www.outlookinn.com/">the Outlook Inn</a>.</p>
